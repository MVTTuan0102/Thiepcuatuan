                            I hope this letter will fly to you because I am filled with an overwhelming sense of admiration and affection. I have been enchanted by your beautiful personality, your goodness, and your sense of humor. Your presence brings me joy, and I find myself daydreaming about you often. I wanted you to know that I have developed strong feelings for you and I canâ€™t keep it to myself any longer and I would be thrilled if you would consider getting to know me on a deeper level. I would love the chance to explore a deeper connection with you and see where this amazing journey takes us.
